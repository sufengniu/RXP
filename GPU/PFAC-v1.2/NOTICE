We adopt Thrust in our implementation. 

Thrust is an open source library of parallel algorithms with an interface resembling the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).  The primary developers of Thrust are Jared Hoberock and Nathan Bell of NVIDIA Research. And contributors are  
  * Andrew Corrigan
  * Duane Merrill
  * Erich Elsen
  * Gregory Diamos
  * Mark Harris

Thrust can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/thrust/

We include Thrust 1.3.0 in the root of the library, users don't need to download Thrust.

The authors offer heartfelt thanks to Grigory Dobrov who found two bugs, one is time-consuming table building step and the other is intermittent failure when host threads share one PFAC context on single GPU.
These two bugs are fixed in r1.2.
